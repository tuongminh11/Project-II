#define EVSE_Failed_To_Turn_Off_AC                       					0xE091 // Alarm E091: EVSE Failed To Turn Off AC - Charger is communicating with EVSE but it is not turning off AC. Check EVSE contactor for welding. Check cables and connections. If persists, try another EVSE.
#define Charger_Reflash_Error                            					0xE092 // Alarm E092: Charger Reflash Error - Check the configuration file is appropriate for this charger model. Check use of the correct version of programming tool or protocol.
#define Aux_DC_Output_Short_Circuit                     					0xE093 // Alarm E093: Aux DC Output Short Circuit - Check for wiring errors. Check for faulty or shorted battery cells. Check for too much load on Aux Output.
#define AC_Input_Voltage_High_Spikes                     					0xE094 // Alarm E094: AC Input Voltage High Spikes - Monitor for stable AC voltage. Frequent spikes above 280VAC may damage the charger input.
#define Safe_Disconnect_Alarm                            					0xE095 // Alarm E095: Safe Disconnect Alarm - Safe disconnect pin not connected but the primary contact pin connected. Ensure correct style of connector is used and the pins are installed correctly.
#define Charger_Operating_Voltage_Too_Low                 					0xE096 // Alarm E096: Charger Operating Voltage Too Low - Raise charger output voltage above 21.0VDC to reduce thermal stress to internal components.
